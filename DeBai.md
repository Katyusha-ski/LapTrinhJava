Abbreviation: AESP

Context:

In the era of globalization, English speaking proficiency has become an essential requirement for personal and professional development. However, many English learners in Vietnam face significant psychological barriers when practicing speaking, such as shyness, fear of making mistakes, lack of practice partners, and the absence of a suitable practice environment. 

The demand for effective English-speaking practice is increasing due to the language requirements in education, business, and tourism. Traditional learning methods often emphasize grammar and reading comprehension, leaving speaking skills underdeveloped. Vietnamese learners also face challenges related to pronunciation and often lack confidence in real-life conversations.

Limited access to native speakers or proficient conversation partners makes real-world practice difficult. Fear of judgment further discourages learners from speaking, creating a cycle where insufficient practice leads to persistent anxiety about speaking.

Proposed Solutions:

A partially AI-assisted application for English learners to practice speaking in a judgment-free environment. The AI acts as a conversation assistant, offering on-screen vocabulary, example sentences, and responses during learner interactions, along with instant pronunciation feedback and adaptive learning paths for various scenarios (business, travel, daily life).

Evaluates users’ English proficiency via an initial speaking test, then creates a tailored learning path. Lower-level learners receive full sentence suggestions, while advanced learners get only key phrases. AI tracks progress, refines lessons, and supports real-time pronunciation improvement.

Supports Learners, who access AI-guided practice, progress tracking, and personalized exercises, and Administrators, who manage accounts, moderate content, handle payments, and monitor performance.
